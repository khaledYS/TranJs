# a library inspired by wow.js and i call it tarn.js
 its smoother of wow.js bcz i dont use a lot of code
 and the idea is deffrent than wow.js
 the idea is once the element get visible in the client borwser it will take of the class tarn and replace it with any thing you want 
 and a little secret sence you came here
 i made tran a shortcut for traniton
 dont till anyone
 by the time of making this repo
 before we get started 
 if you like it a star will be the best


 # installing
 you can use it by importing it from cdn links 
 or download [it](http://127.0.0.1:5500/tran/README.md)
 you should import it with
 in the html 
 first thing you wanna add is the js file and 
 ```html
    <script defer src="tran.js"></script>
```
 and the css file suppose to be imported in the head tag
 ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="tran.css">
```
and if you wanna an html template
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- required tags  -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    
    <!--   importing tranJs Library   -->
    <script defer src="tran.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="tran.css">
 
</head>
<body>
  hello world   
</body>
</html>
 and both of their links will change debends if you are importing it from cdn or you download it 


 # Using
 usign it is going to be some thing else 
 its easy 
 and i tried to give the best exprience and best and fast library
 to use it 
 after you include it in your html
 you give the element that you want for him to be traned
 you give him a "tran" class
 like : 
```html
 <p class='tran'>Hello world from tranJs...</p>
```
 and then you add the class that you want to replace it with tran class 
 like so :
```html 
 <p class="tran" tran-data-class-to="animation" >Hello world from tranJs...</p>
 ```

 and magic happens !!!
 Happy hackingðŸ˜ˆ!!
